            There was a strange <span id="subject">English</span> classroom in the school I used to go to.
            <br>
            When I <span id="movement">walked</span> into the room, I always felt someone tap me on my shoulder.<br>
            <br>
            Even if I was the only one there.<br>
            <br>
            Every day, the <span id="part">wallpaper</span> started off <span id="color">white</span>, but by the time I left, it turned a creepy <span id="colortwo">blood red</span>.<br>
            <br>
            And that's not all.<br>
            <br>
            Whenever I looked at the <span id="object">clock</span>, I saw eyes staring at me from seemingly inside its surface.<br>
            <br>
            The eyes were <span id="adjective">terrifying</span>, black as coal and <span id="looking">glaring</span> directly at me.<br>
            <br>
            But no one else seemed to notice.<br>
            <br>
            That classroom was the reason for the <span id="adverb">first</span> time I ever ditched class.<br>
            <br>
            I skipped <span id="subject2">English</span> countless times that year just to avoid the classroom.<br>
            <br>
            At least now, those are just <span id="memories">distant</span> memories that I don't have to worry about.
